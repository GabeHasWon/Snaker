----- Devilish Arena ------
by GabeHasWon and LetsGo with art from Pyxis
commissioned by LetsGo

A devilish (and starchy!) threat has appeared in the Underworld!
An Arena has appeared within the Underworld, replete with enemies and a massive snake!
Defeat them and the massive Devilish Snake to get some nice rewards.

A new micro-event lurks under the snow! Find and challenge an ancient foe to reap its reward.

In new worlds, a large tower structure will spawn with a broken portal.
The portal slowly recovers as the player progresses, and in Hardmode, is fully repaired.
Therein the player can fight the event.

As mentioned above, this was commissioned by LetsGo! 
This was a very fun project, using Subworlds for the first time was a joy, and creating the Devilish Snake was fun.
